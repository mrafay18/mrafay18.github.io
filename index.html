            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am a senior undergraduate student at Texas A&M University pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering (Class of 2025). With hands-on experience in software development, cybersecurity, and technical support, I have worked at organizations like Apple Inc., Y-12 National Security Complex, and the Texas Department of Transportation. My expertise spans programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and TypeScript, as well as technologies like Unity, Xcode, and Microsoft Azure. I have designed and implemented automation solutions, developed interactive simulations, and optimized security policies. As the President of Eta Kappa Nu (HKN), I contributed to the engineering community. I am passionate about problem-solving, software development, and cybersecurity, and I am eager to explore opportunities that further expand my knowledge and career.</p>
